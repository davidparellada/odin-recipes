    <p class="description">Snowballs, a.k.a. Russian tea cakes or Mexican wedding cookies, are melt-in-your-mouth cookies made with staple ingredients: butter, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, flour, finely chopped nuts, and salt. The round cookies are rolled in powdered sugar, so they sort of resemble snowballs. 
        The festive treat is often served during the holiday season.</p>
    <h2 class="section">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup very finely chopped pecans</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h2 class="section">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Place 1/2 cup powdered sugar in a bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat butter, remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar, and vanilla with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. 
                Gradually mix in flour, pecans, and salt until completely incorporated. 
                Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are light golden brown but tops are still pale, 12 to 15 minutes. 
                (Try not to let cookies get too brown: it's better to undercook them than to overcook them.)</li>
            <li>Remove cookies from the oven and let sit on the baking sheets briefly before removing to wire racks.</li>
            <li>Roll hot cookies in the reserved powdered sugar to coat, then return to the wire racks to cool. 
                Once cooled, roll cookies in the powdered sugar once more.</li>
        </ol>
